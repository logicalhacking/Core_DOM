	abstract  = {In this AFP entry, we formalize the core of the Document Object Model (DOM).
                     At its core, the DOM defines a tree-like data structure for representing documents
                     in general and HTML documents in particular. It is the heart of any modern web
                     browser. Formalizing the key concepts of the DOM is a prerequisite for the formal
                     reasoning over client-side JavaScript programs and for the analysis of security
                     concepts in modern web browsers. We present a formalization of the core DOM, with
                     focus on the node-tree and the operations defined on node-trees, in Isabelle/HOL.
                     We use the formalization to verify the functional correctness of the most important
                     functions defined in the DOM standard. Moreover, our formalization is 1) extensible,
                     i.e., can be extended without the need of re-proving already proven properties
                     and 2) executable, i.e., we can generate executable code from our specification.},
